- Focus accessibility with keyboard navigation
- Fully responsive design

## Technologies Used
- React with hooks (useState)

## How it works
The button uses CSS gradients combined with pseudo-elements to create a blur effect that becomes visible on hover, creating the "glow" appearance. The click handler provides visual feedback with a brief scale animation.
